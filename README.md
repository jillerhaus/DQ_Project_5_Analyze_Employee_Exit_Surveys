# DataQuest Project 5: Analyze Employee Exit Surveys

This is the fifth project in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project a dataset containing data from two Australian institutes is cleaned, combined and analyzed. The main focus of the project is data cleaning. The analysis of the data itself is very short.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` files to run.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install) The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy` and `Pandas` and matplotlib to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console
